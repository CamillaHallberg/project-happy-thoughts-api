# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project was about building an API that included both GET request endpoints (to return data) and POST request endpoints (to create new data). For this project we built our own API to use in our previously made React project Happy Thoughts (a Twitter like feed containing only positive vibes! :)) The objective was to dig deeper into the use of MongoDB and Express. 

## The problem

I started off as I usually do, going through the video and reading material to get an understanding of how to create POST requests and how to handle errors and how to use validation. I found this weeks material to be of great use and also the first lecture for this week handed me a good start to begin with the project. I think the instructions on the lecture were greatly applicable to the project and the only thing to do was to figure out good naming of variables and then to try out the code in Postman. I think this was a fun part, to see the POST requests working and it was extra fulfilling to nailing the request where the user will be able to like a post/a happy thought. One of the trickier parts for me this week was to get everything set up with MongoDB Atlas (since I did not participate in last weeks project) but when that was sorted out and I managed to deploy to Heroku it was fun to exchange the Techngio API that was used in the Happy Thoughts project with my own, newly build API. It felt really nice to see that it worked :)
